  <p>Meet the CEOs of FoodSeek! Adam and James are two best buds attending UCSC while trying to put a stop to food waste that sadly accounts for about 30-40% of all US food supply in 2020 alone. The time to act is now, especially during a global pandemic when jobs are scarce and people find it harder to feed their families each day. Covid-19 has made it difficult for all of us, especially for those in need. By creating a platform where grocery stores are able to easily list food inventory items that they would otherwise throw away at the end of the week for food banks and customers to seek out at a minutes notice, we will not only mitigate the food waste problem in this country, but we will also bring our communities closer together during a time of isolation and uncertainty.</p>
